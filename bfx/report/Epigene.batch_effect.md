Batch effects are the systematic non-biological variations between different batches or groups of samples. They need to removed before the differential methylation analysis because presence of batch effects may confound biological differences.

Effects of batch effect correction may be visualized by plotting a principal analysis component (PCA) graph.

In the dataset provided, batch column was specified by "$batch_column$".
